    Not all objects need to both save and load, which is why they are seperate

    Merged with Miro's changes
    
    ~ Fixed: Player header file in wrong location
    ~ Added: Stub class for Item
    ~ Added: Style guide in markdown. (View it in VS Code). It's not concrete! just a start.
    
    After including the player file, I corrected a few minor issue so we can compile.
    
    ~ Fixed: Initialize signature in .cpp did not match
    ~ Fixed: "PlayerName" was used in a few places, swapped it with "UserName" as per UML
    ~ Fixed: Boost includes added for uuid, in
    ~ Fixed: Array declarations, had type and name switched.
    ~ Fixed: Array declarations did not include size. C# can have dynamic array declarations, but C++ can't. It's really annoying.
